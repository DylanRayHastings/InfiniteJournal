### Contributing Code

#### Finding Issues to Work On

- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for beginner-friendly tasks
- Check issues labeled `help wanted` for areas where we need assistance
- Feel free to ask questions on any issue you're interested in

#### Before You Start Coding

1. **Check if someone is already working on it**
   - Look for assigned issues or recent comments
   - Comment on the issue to express your interest

2. **Discuss major changes**
   - For significant changes, open an issue first
   - Get feedback on your approach before investing time

3. **Keep your fork updated**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

## Development Process

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow the style guidelines

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=infinitejournal

# Run linting
flake8 src/
mypy src/
black --check src/
isort --check-only src/
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Follow our commit message conventions (see [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines))

### 5. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

- Use the PR template
- Link related issues
- Ensure all checks pass

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:
- Line length: 100 characters
- Use Black for formatting
- Use isort for import ordering

### Code Style Examples

```python
# Good: Clear variable names
player_position = Vector3(x=0, y=0, z=0)

# Bad: Unclear abbreviations
pp = V3(0, 0, 0)

# Good: Type hints
def calculate_distance(point_a: Vector3, point_b: Vector3) -> float:
    """Calculate Euclidean distance between two points."""
    return (point_b - point_a).magnitude()

# Good: Docstrings (Google style)
def render_stroke(stroke: Stroke, camera: Camera) -> None:
    """Render a stroke to the screen.
    
    Args:
        stroke: The stroke to render
        camera: Current camera for view transformation
        
    Raises:
        RenderError: If the stroke cannot be rendered
    """
    pass
```

### Directory Structure

```
src/infinitejournal/
â”œâ”€â”€ module/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py      # Public API exports
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core.py          # Core functionality
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py        # Data models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py         # Helper functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tests/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ test_core.py
```

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

```python
def test_stroke_creation_with_valid_points():
    """Test that a stroke can be created with valid points."""
    # Arrange
    points = [Point(0, 0, 0), Point(1, 1, 1)]
    
    # Act
    stroke = Stroke(points)
    
    # Assert
    assert len(stroke.points) == 2
    assert stroke.points[0] == Point(0, 0, 0)
```

## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Examples
```
feat(drawing): add pressure sensitivity to brush tool

Implement pressure sensitivity for stylus input devices.
This allows for more natural drawing with varying line weights.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(renderer): prevent memory leak in stroke rendering

The stroke vertex buffer was not being properly released,
causing memory usage to increase over time.
```
